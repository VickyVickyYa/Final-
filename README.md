# Final-

My project is called Halloween Trivia, if you searched up 40,000 plus results will show up,  very original. What this site does is to jumpstart the halloween nostalgia, 

A user who goes on this will be playing trivia but multiple choice, they select one and after a billion halloween themed questions they get their score and be haunted by the ghost called Debby an ex api chatbot in her past life died of failed to fetch, a heart perhaps? (API is not part of this project just a reference) 

The reason I made it is because when those around me would experience Halloween. It's usually parties, trick or treating, going to corn mazes and experiencing freight induced heart attacks from the dedicated actors over there. Halloween for me is staying home, maybe getting my hands on sweets, hiding under blankets and watching the latest horror film. Well this Halloween things have changed. I am going to invite my friends to my house to watch movies together and introduce games such as —Halloween Trivia —-- and eat Candy as if cavities is a foreign word, or in the index of an Urban Dictionary. In conclusion, I need to entertain my lovely guests. 

Building  my project was ironically eventful, it was last minute planned. I can't believe I pulled it off in my crammed schedule, that transitioned me into a caffeine craving night owl. 

Halloween trivia is made first by HTML structure for example  using divs to organize my webpage for the trivia game container having all my buttons in. Styling with CSS was fun, features included were background  gradients, a beautiful fade espresso color. The heading <h1> Play if you dare with> or Halloween Trivia its flickering feature is pretty neat. Falling leaves feature really sets the mood I found on CodePen. And the music that can be triggered with click from Java script. I have to mention the google fonts, I thought VS code suggested fonts were to end all be all. 

For the Trivia to work I used Javascript. I needed the buttons to be functional so when someone clicks it will tell them if they're wrong or right and keep track of the ones they aced. For example document.gitElementById() can grab parts of the page such as the next-btn and open a door for how that button will be used. 

Javascript was pretty intimidating with all the {}{“;’;]]\][]’;||||}{{}\\\\\\\[]\ yes I slammed the keyboard to produce this monstrosity. So I used a  standard tutorial on youtube explaining how to make a quiz, it was about 34 minutes long, with the constant debugging and  individual customization it took time. I struggled closing and opening brackets, making sure everything matched my html file, differentiating from static code -remove it. The live server was not running, which took time to fix. 

What I learned is that Javescript can look complex (well to me) but just start small, and build your way from there so you won’t feel too overwhelmed. 

Thank you for reading!
